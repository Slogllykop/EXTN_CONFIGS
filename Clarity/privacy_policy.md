# Privacy Policy for Clarity

**Effective Date:** February 17, 2026

At Clarity, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how Clarity ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

Clarity is designed to help you monitor and manage your digital wellbeing. To provide these services, the extension collects and processes the following information:

- **Browsing Activity:** We track the domains of the websites you visit and the duration of your stay on each site. This is used solely to generate your personal screen time reports and enforce the usage timers you set.
- **Website Metadata:** We may store website favicons (icons) to provide a better visual experience in your dashboard.
- **User Settings:** We store your custom website timers, blocklists, and notification preferences.

## 2. Local Storage - Your Data Stays with You

The core principle of Clarity is **Privacy-First**.

- **No Cloud Sync:** All browsing data, analytics, and settings are stored **locally** on your device using your browser's IndexedDB and local storage.
- **No Remote Collection:** We do not upload your browsing history, usage statistics, or any personal information to any external servers.
- **No Data Selling:** We never sell, rent, or trade your data with third parties. We do not have access to your data.

## 3. Use of Permissions

Clarity requests the following permissions for the specific reasons listed below:

- **Tabs & WebNavigation:** To identify which website is active and calculate accurate screen time.
- **Storage:** To save your analytics and settings locally on your computer.
- **Alarms:** To schedule periodic data saves and reset your daily stats.
- **Notifications:** To alert you when you reach your set time limits.
- **Idle:** To pause tracking when you are away from your computer.
- **DeclarativeNetRequest:** To block access to websites when your set limits are exceeded.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

Your data is stored on your device as long as the extension is installed. You have full control over your data:

- **Export Data:** You can export all your tracked activity into a JSON file at any time from the settings.
- **Delete Data:** You can clear your entire browsing history and reset all settings within the extension dashboard.
- **Uninstallation:** If you uninstall Clarity, all data stored locally by the extension will be automatically deleted by the browser.

## 5. Third-Party Websites

Clarity tracks your activity on third-party websites to provide analytics, but it does not interact with the content of those websites beyond monitoring the URL and active time. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those external sites.

## 6. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We recommend checking this page periodically.
