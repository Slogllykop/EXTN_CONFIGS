# Privacy Policy for Oculus: Screen Share

**Effective Date:** 24/02/2026

At Oculus, we believe that your digital privacy is paramount. Our mission is to provide a high-performance screen-sharing solution that respects user autonomy and data integrity. This Privacy Policy outlines how the Oculus: Screen Share extension handles data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
Oculus is designed as a **Privacy-First** application. We do not collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 

*   **No User Accounts:** You do not need to create an account or provide an email address to use Oculus.
*   **No Data Logging:** We do not log your browsing history, keystrokes, or screen content. 
*   **Media Stream:** Your screen recording is processed locally within your browser using the native WebRTC API. The video and audio data are streamed directly to your intended viewer via a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) connection. This data is never routed through, or stored on, our servers.

## 2. Technical Data and Signaling
To facilitate the Peer-to-Peer connection between the broadcaster (Extension) and the viewer (Web App), we use a minimal signaling process:
*   **Session IDs:** A temporary, unique Session ID is generated when you start a broadcast. This ID is used solely to allow the viewer to locate and connect to your browser.
*   **ICE/TURN Servers:** We utilize industry-standard signaling and TURN servers to help establish the P2P connection through firewalls. These servers facilitate the handshake process only and do not have access to the actual media content of your stream.

## 3. Security
By design, Oculus leverages the robust security of the WebRTC protocol, which includes mandatory encryption for all media streams. This ensures that your screen share remains private between you and the individuals with whom you share your unique link.

## 4. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
