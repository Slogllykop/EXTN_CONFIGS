# Privacy Policy for Echo

**Last Updated:** 20/2/2026

## Data Collection

Echo ("the Extension") does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal user data, browsing history, or network traffic to external servers or third parties.

## Data Usage

- **Network Requests**: The Extension intercepts network requests (fetch/XHR) solely for the purpose of processing user-defined rules (mocking/patching) within the browser. This processing happens locally on your device.
- **Local Storage**: User-created rules and configurations are stored locally in your browser's `IndexedDB` and `chrome.storage` mechanisms.

## Permissions

- **Host Permissions**: Used exclusively to inject functionality into web pages to enable request interception. The Extension does not monitor browsing activity outside of the developer tools functionality.
- **Storage**: Used to save your settings and mock rules globally.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension operates entirely offline and does not integrate with any third-party analytics or tracking services.
